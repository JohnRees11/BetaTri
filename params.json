{"name":"TrapFlight","tagline":"Fork of Betaflight focusing on improvement of PID loops and loop time and better tricopter servo proformence","body":"#Improving the feel and performance of Cleanflight based flight controllers \r\nTrapFlight improves on the improvements made in both Cleanflight and Beataflight by changing the way that the I value is calculated in PID control theory using trapezoids.\r\n##Why Trapezoids?\r\nThe old version of the PID loops shown in MultiWII, Cleanflight, and Beatflight, used rectangles to calculate the integral value of PID control.  This, however, leads to many error in the calculation as seen below.\r\n\r\nIf we replace these rectangles with trapezoids we then have a higher accuracy rate and faster loop time due to having to do less calculations.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
